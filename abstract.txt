# Bare Beyond Blinky: "Normal" Bare-Metal Rust

Last month at PDXRust we got an extremely simple embedded
Rust program, a "blinky", running on a BBC micro:bit
(https://github.com/BartMassey/an-inordinate-display).

This month, we will look at the hardware available to us on
the micro:bit and do a lightning survey of the most-used
techniques for using this hardware with bare-metal Rust.
There will be many examples, and things will move fairly
quickly, with exciting lights and sounds. We will peek at
peripheral registers, interrupts and DMA as we make these
things happen.

You do not need to be an "advanced" Rust programmer to
follow this talk, but we will breeze by a lot of the
language as we go.
